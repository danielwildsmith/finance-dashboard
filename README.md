# Finance Dashboard Website

## Description
A personal project that aggregates data from multiple banking accounts into a centralized platform, powered by the Plaid API. Users can easily gain financial insights by viewing detailed and up-to-date charts and graphs, including net worth over time and month-to-month transaction comparisons. The website also features a Material UI table where users can verify and add notes to transactions. 

The backend server is deployed using Firebase Cloud Functions and includes JWT authentication for secure user access. A daily background job updates the MySQL database with the latest transaction and balance data.

For easy exploration, the website provides sample data accessible with the following credentials: username: **sample**, password: **password**. Please note that linking your personal financial accounts involves risks that should be considered.
